# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Native Slides are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. Omit any category with no entries. On release, rename [Unreleased] to the version with its date and start a fresh empty [Unreleased] above it.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Bottom bar: the "No properties" placeholder is removed — deck pages (frontmatter with only the reserved `deck` key) show just the nav buttons and page number, and the bar hides entirely when there is nothing to display.
- Navigation: the ◀ ▶ arrows are always both shown inside a deck; the one that cannot move (first page's ◀, last page's ▶) is disabled and light gray.
- Settings: the bar-hidden and auto-fullscreen toggles are now persisted (previously reset on reload); auto-fullscreen is also exposed in the settings tab.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Reading-view properties bar: hides the native status bar and renders the current note's frontmatter properties as chips in a bottom bar.
- Immersive fullscreen reading mode: ribbon, sidebars, tab bar and pane header are hidden and OS fullscreen is requested; `Esc` exits fullscreen and reading view together.
- PPT-style deck navigation driven by one reserved frontmatter property `deck` (overview + next links), with auto-computed page numbers — no stored `page-number` property.
- Previous Page / Next Page commands (default `Mod+Shift+←/→`, rebindable under Settings → Hotkeys).
- Settings tab toggling the ◀ ▶ buttons and the page number.
- Example vault (`example-vault/`) with a demo deck and an overview page embedding an Obsidian Base view.
